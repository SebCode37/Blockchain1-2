# Blockchain Course 1 and 2

## Overview

Blockchain Course 1 and 2! In these courses, we explorex key concepts and practical implementations in the blockchain space. From basic smart contract development to decentralized application (DApp) creation, we gained hands-on experience with various blockchain tools and technologies.

## Course Content

### Solidity Smart Contracts

- Learn to write simple smart contracts using Solidity.
- Explore ERC20 and ERC721 standards for token creation.

### DApp Development - TicTacToe

- Engage in DApp development with a practical example: RockPaperScissors.
- Understand how to create decentralized games on the blockchain.

### Software Architecture

- Dive into software architecture concepts applied to blockchain.
- Develop a simple ticket issuance system using blockchain technology.
- Draw inspiration from the GET Protocol and explore Polygonâ€™s architecture.

## Tools and Technologies
